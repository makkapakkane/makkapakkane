# About me 

   THIS ACCOUNT IS PURELY FOR PONYTOWN !!!

Hii! I'm Pakkane, but you can call me either Pakka or whichever character I'm cosplaying.
I usually sit by the main pathway in ponytown or the Stranger Things fandom! So if you need to find me I'll be in either of those spots. If you do see me don't be shy to sit and or talk with me! I love meeting new people ^_^ Though I might be afk, but you can just pop me a whisper and I'll most likely respond! Oh, and I can be a bit awkward, I'm not the best with socializing with people.

I have quite a few interest, most are dormant though. My interests consists of; IT, Gorillaz, Undertale, Sk8 the Infinity, The Promised Neverland, Sonic the Hedgehog, Haikyuu!! Five Nights at Freddy's, Day Shift at Freddy's, Trolls, Bungo Stray Dogs, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Stranger Things, and probably more that I can't think of right now xb.

And as for my current active interests they are; Gorillaz, Valorant, Stranger Things & IT.

I have little to no hobbies, but the few I do have I'll put here > Drawing (traditonal, sometimes digital although I am not very good at it) And reading.

I hope this helps you get to know me a bit better! Also c+h are always appreciated <3
